Pikchr Command-Line Tool
========================
[This preprocessor tool][repo] reads text from the standard input, replacing
suitably-delimited [Pikchr][] (a [PIC][]-like diagram language) diagram
descriptions with inline [Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)][SVG], and writes
to the standard output.  It’s [intended to be composed][Unix] with your
favorite Markdown processor, but can be used standalone or with other markup
languages or workflows too.

This tool uses the [C reference implementation of Pikchr by Richard Hipp][DRH]
which is included here for convenience (as permitted by its generous license).

``` pikchr @usage requote delimiters x-current-color details open

```

GitHub doesn’t allow inline SVGs, so here’s the above diagram as an external
image reference (see Example 3 below):

<img width="755px" src="usage.svg"/>

Example 1: Pipeline

    $ pikchr < file.md | md2html > file.html

Example 2: Intermediate file

    $ pikchr < README.md.in > README.md
    $ md2html < README.md > README.html

Example 3: Compile the diagram in `README.md.in` that is tagged with modifier
“`@usage`” to a separate SVG file called `usage.svg`

    $ pikchr -q -b -N @usage < README.md.in > usage.svg

Delimiters
----------
A Pikchr diagram starts with a line beginning with any of the following strings
_without indentation_:

* Three or more consecutive `GRAVE ACCENT` backtick (<code>&#96;</code>)
  characters, optional whitespace, the characters `pikchr`, and
  whitespace or end-of-line; for example
   - <code>```` pikchr</code>
* Three or more consecutive `TILDE` (`~`) characters, optional whitespace,
  the characters `pikchr`, and whitespace or end-of-line; for example
   - `~~~pikchr`
* The three characters `.PS` and whitespace or end-of-line (that is, the
  traditional [PIC][] start delimiter)
   - `.PS`

and ends with the next line that is any of the following strings
_without indentation_ (or the end of the file):

* Three or more consecutive backtick characters and optional whitespace; for example
   - <code>```</code>
* Three or more consecutive `TILDE` characters and optional whitespace; for example
   - `~~~~`
* The three characters `.PE` and optional whitespace (that is, the traditional
  [PIC][] end delimiter)
   - `.PE`

Anything not between a pair of start and end delimiters is copied to the
standard output unchanged.

Note that generic Markdown [fenced code blocks][fenced] can begin with three
or more consecutive `TILDE` (`~`) or backtick (<code>&#96;</code>) characters
optionally indented by up to three spaces, and continue to a fence of the
same type (tilde or backtick), optionally indented by up to three spaces, and
_at least as long_. For simplicity, when looking for Pikchr diagrams, this
tool doesn’t require the end delimiter to be of the same type or to be at
least as long as the start delimiter. This tool doesn’t recognize indented
start and end delimiters in order to easily accommodate displaying Pikchr
code itself by using an indented fenced code block.

### Start Delimiter Modifiers

Any number of whitespace-delimited modifier strings can follow the start
delimiter prefix on the same line. Modifiers can change the behavior of the
Pikchr formatter for just that diagram. Unrecognized modifiers are ignored,
but can be matched by the `-N` command-line option (use `-h` to see all of
the available options). The following modifiers are recognized:

* `bare-svg`: Output the `<svg>` tag without wrapping it in a `<div>`. By default
  (unless command-line option `-b` is given) each diagram is enclosed in a
  `<div>` styled with `max-width` set to the diagram’s width, so it won’t
  expand to the width of the page (which is usually not desired). `svg-only`
  is a synonym for `bare-svg`.
* `requote`: Output the Pikchr source of this diagram in an indented code block
  after the compiled diagram. Use the `-R` command-line option to set this mode
  for all diagrams.
* `delimiters`: If requoting, include the start and end delimiter lines. The
  default is to not include the start and end delimiters in a requote.
* `details`: If requoting, put the requoted source into a `<details>`
  element. Note that the output is [CommonMark][] compliant, but some older
  non-CommonMark formatters (such as `Markdown.pl`) might format `<details>` incorrectly.
  The `<summary>` content is set with the `-s` command-line option and defaults
  to “`Pikchr Source`”. Use the `-D` command-line option to set this mode
  for all diagrams.
* `open`: Set the `open` attribute of the `<details>` element so that the
  requoted Pikchr source starts out visible/open/disclosed.
* `x-current-color`: Experimental, output CSS `currentColor` instead of
  `rgb(0,0,0)` for numeric color value 0 (black, the default marking
  color in diagrams). The diagram will be painted in the SVG element’s
  inherited foreground color instead of the default black, which may enable
  naturally adapting to different page themes or dark mode. Note that only
  color value 0 is affected. To force black, set the color to a positive
  number less than 0.5. Use the `-C` command-line option to set this
  experimental mode for all diagrams.

Building
--------

    $ git clone https://github.com/zenomt/pikchr-cmd
    $ cd pikchr-cmd
    $ make all
    $ ./pikchr -h

Command Line Options
--------------------
The following command line options are recognized:

* <code>-c <em>aClass</em></code>  
  Add attribute <code>class="<em>aClass</em>"</code> to all generated `<svg>` tags.
* <code>-a <em>arbitrary-attributes</em></code>  
  Add _arbitrary-attributes_ string to all generated `<svg>` tags. For compatibility with
  the behavior of the latest upstream [Pikchr][], the default value is `style='font-size:initial;'`;
  consider including this style directive if appropriate to any custom setting of this parameter.
* <code>-s <em>summary-content</em></code>  
  Change the raw HTML content of the `<summary>` element when requoting diagram source in a `<details>`
  element. The default value is `Pikchr Source`.
* <code>-S <em>arbitrary-attributes</em></code>  
  Add _arbitrary-attributes_ string to all generated `<summary>` tags.
* `-b`  
  “Bare SVG mode”: don’t enclose generated SVG elements in a `<div>`. By default a `<div>` wrapper is used to apply a `max-width` style to the diagram to keep it from expanding to the full window width. Use this option to manually style the diagram’s displayed size with your own DIV or when generating a standalone SVG file. This can also be enabled per-diagram with the `bare-svg` modifier.
* `-p`  
  Generate plaintext error messages. The default is to output HTML-formatted errors.
* `-d`  
  Enable “dark mode” in the Pikchr formatter. But consider using `-C` or modifier `x-current-color`
  for a more flexible solution for “dark mode”.
* `-C`  
  Behave as though the experimental `x-current-color` modifier (use CSS `currentColor` instead of `rgb(0,0.0)` for numeric color value 0) was set on all diagrams. See the description of the `x-current-color` modifier above for more information.
* `-R`  
  Requote every diagram’s source, as though the `requote` modifier was set on all diagrams.
* `-D`  
  Put all requoted diagram source in `<details>` elements, as though the `details` modifier was set on all diagrams.
* `-q`  
  “Quiet mode”: don’t copy non-diagram input to the output. Use this option when generating a standalone SVG file.
* `-Q`  
  Remove all Pikchr diagrams from the output.
* <code>-N <i>mod-string</i></code>  
  Only translate diagrams that have _mod-string_ as one of their [start delimiter modifiers](#start-delimiter-modifiers). This is usually used along with `-q` and `-b` when generating a standalone SVG file (in which case _mod-string_ should be unique).
* `-h`  
  Show the help message describing these options and quit.

SVG to PNG Conversion Tool
--------------------------
[`svg2png.html`](https://zenomt.github.io/svg2png/svg2png.html) is a
tiny and bare-bones HTML+JavaScript tool you can use to convert an SVG (such
as one generated by the `pikchr` tool) to a
[Portable Network Graphics (PNG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/png/) image file
locally using your web browser’s SVG rasterizer, for use in situations or
applications that don’t support SVG.
