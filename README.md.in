Pikchr Command-Line Driver
==========================
[This preprocessor tool][repo] reads text from the standard input, [replacing][Unix]
suitably-delimited [Pikchr][] diagrams (a [PIC][]-like diagram language) with
inline Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), and writes to the standard output.
It’s intended for use with your favorite Markdown processor, but can be used
standalone or with other markup languages too.

This tool uses the [C reference implementation of Pikchr by Richard Hipp][DRH]
which is included here for convenience (as permitted by its generous license).

``` pikchr @usage
arrow right 225% "Markdown+Pikchr" "Source"
Tool: box rad 5px "pikchr" mono "Preprocessor" "(main.c)" mono fit
arrow same "Markdown+SVG" "Intermediate"
box same "Any Markdown" "Formatter" fit
arrow same "HTML+SVG" "Output"
arrow <-> down from Tool.south; "C API" ljust at 0.5*charwid right of previous
box with .north at last arrow.end same "Pikchr" "Formatter" "(pikchr.c)" mono fit
```

    ``` pikchr @usage
    arrow right 225% "Markdown+Pikchr" "Source"
    Tool: box rad 5px "pikchr" mono "Preprocessor" "(main.c)" mono fit
    arrow same "Markdown+SVG" "Intermediate"
    box same "Any Markdown" "Formatter" fit
    arrow same "HTML+SVG" "Output"
    arrow <-> down from Tool.south; "C API" ljust at 0.5*charwid right of previous
    box with .north at last arrow.end same "Pikchr" "Formatter" "(pikchr.c)" mono fit
    ```

GitHub doesn’t allow inline SVGs, so here’s the above diagram as an external
image reference:

<img width="755px" src="usage.svg"/>

Example: Pipeline

    $ pikchr < file.md | Markdown.pl > file.html

Example: Intermediate file

    $ pikchr < README.md.in > README.md
    $ Markdown.pl < README.md > README.html

Example: Compile the diagram in `README.md.in` that is tagged with modifier
“`@usage`” to a separate SVG file called `usage.svg`

    $ pikchr -qb -N @usage < README.md.in > usage.svg

Delimiters
----------
A Pikchr diagram starts with a line beginning with any of the following strings
_without indentation_:

* Three or more consecutive `GRAVE ACCENT` backtick (<code>&#96;</code>)
  characters, optional whitespace, the characters `pikchr`, and
  whitespace or end-of-line; for example
   - <code>```` pikchr</code>
* Three or more consecutive `TILDE` (`~`) characters, optional whitespace,
  the characters `pikchr`, and whitespace or end-of-line; for example
   - `~~~pikchr`
* The three characters `.PS` and whitespace or end-of-line (that is, the
  traditional [PIC][] start delimiter)
   - `.PS`

and ends with the next line that is any of the following strings
_without indentation_ (or the end of the file):

* Three or more consecutive backtick characters and optional whitespace; for example
   - <code>```</code>
* Three or more consecutive `TILDE` characters and optional whitespace; for example
   - `~~~~`
* The three characters `.PE` and optional whitespace (that is, the traditional
  [PIC][] end delimiter)
   - `.PE`

Anything not between a pair of start and end delimiters is copied to the
standard output unchanged.

Note that generic Markdown [fenced code blocks][fenced] can begin with three
or more consecutive `TILDE` (`~`) or backtick (<code>&#96;</code>) characters
optionally indented by up to three spaces, and continue to a fence of the
same type (tilde or backtick), optionally indented by up to three spaces, and
_at least as long_. For simplicity, when looking for Pikchr diagrams, this
tool doesn’t require the end delimiter to be of the same type or to be at
least as long as the start delimiter. This tool doesn’t recognize indented
start and end delimiters in order to easily accommodate displaying Pikchr
code itself by using an indented fenced code block.

### Start Delimiter Modifiers

Any number of whitespace-delimited modifier strings can follow the start
delimiter prefix on the same line. Modifiers can change the behavior of the
Pikchr formatter for just that diagram. Unrecognized modifiers are ignored,
but can be matched by the `-N` command-line option (use `-h` to see all of
the available options). The following modifier is recognized:

* `svg-only`: Output the `<svg>` tag without wrapping it in a `<div>`. By default
  (unless command-line option `-b` is given) each diagram is enclosed in a
  `<div>` styled with `max-width` set to the diagram’s width, so it won’t
  expand to the width of the page (which is usually not desired).

Building
--------

    $ git clone https://github.com/zenomt/pikchr-cmd
    $ cd pikchr-cmd
    $ make all
    $ ./pikchr -h

Command Line Options
--------------------
The following command line options are recognized:

* <code>-c <i>aClass</i></code>  
  Add attribute <code>class="<i>aClass</i>"</code> to all generated `<svg>` tags.
* `-b`  
  “Bare SVG mode”: don’t enclose generated SVG elements in a `<div>`. By default a `<div>` wrapper is used to apply a `max-width` style to the diagram to keep it from expanding to the full window width. Use this option to manually style the diagram’s displayed size with your own DIV or when generating a standalone SVG file. This can also be enabled per-diagram with the `svg-only` modifier.
* `-p`  
  Generate plaintext error messages. The default is to output HTML-formatted errors.
* `-d`  
  Enable “dark mode” in the Pikchr formatter.
* `-q`  
  “Quiet mode”: don’t copy non-diagram input to the output. Use this option when generating a standalone SVG file.
* `-Q`  
  Remove all Pikchr diagrams from the output.
* <code>-n <i>num</i></code>  
  Only translate diagram number _num_ to SVG. Diagrams are numbered starting from 1.  This is usually used along with `-q` and `-b` when generating a standalone SVG file. Note that this method is brittle, consider using `-N` instead.
* <code>-N <i>mod-string</i></code>  
  Only translate the first diagram that has _mod-string_ as one of its [start delimiter modifiers](#start-delimiter-modifiers). This is usually used along with `-q` and `-b` when generating a standalone SVG file.
* `-h`  
  Show the help message listing these options and quit.
