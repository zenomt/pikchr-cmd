/* The main interface.  Invoke this routine to translate PIKCHR source
** text into SVG. The SVG is returned in a buffer obtained from malloc().
** The caller is responsible for freeing the buffer.
**
** If an error occurs, *pnWidth is filled with a negative number and
** the return buffer contains error message text instead of SVG.  By
** default, the error message is HTML encoded.  However, error messages
** come out as plaintext if the PIKCHR_PLAINTEXT_ERRORS flag is included
** as one of the bits in the mFlags parameter.
